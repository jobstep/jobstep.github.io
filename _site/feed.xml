In addition, customer success identifies repeat problems and escalates to the technical or business team. This type of role is relatively new and found mostly in the IT industry, and the actual day-to-day work can vary based on the specific company and product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the same as Customer Support, which is generally a call-center job to answer customer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;typical-salary&quot;&gt;Typical Salary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$40K-$80K depending on experience and cost-of-living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stories&quot;&gt;Work Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tatiana is a Customer Success Manager at Geyser, a Software-as-a-Service company that sells automation tools to help companies onboard hourly workers faster. We asked her to answer several questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-a-typical-day-look-like&quot;&gt;What does a typical day look like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I start my morning by reviewing our ticketing system to see if there are any high-priority issues that need resolution. I see that our biggest client is having trouble importing applications from a different software tool, so I text my point of contact there to set up a video call for later in the afternoon. When I get to the office, the CS team has its daily standup meeting where we discuss the biggest issues that our clients are having, and make sure that each one of them is assigned to a different team member. Our manager also reviews our metrics from the day before: Tickets closed, feedback surveys completed, and the all-important NPS product rating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I then have my first call of the day, which is onboarding a new client with a very simple workflow and a low volume. This is easy, as I can just use a template in the software and show them how to customize it to meet their needs. We screenshare over the video call, and everything goes smoothly. Next, I am called into the product design meeting to discuss some of the user interface issues that my big client has been having. The product manager and engineers discuss various solutions to fix it, and come up with two possible alternatives. I am tasked with asking the big client which fix they like better. I send an email to our point of contact explaining this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By this time, it’s lunch and I get a text while my mouth is full of salad from another client about billing. They are one of Geyser’s first clients, and were recently upgraded to a more expensive plan. They are not happy about paying more, and are now trying to get a discount by pointing out all the problems and bugs in the software. I file a bug report based on their complaint, and send them an email saying we will fix it. I don’t mention the pricing issue at all. That’s a problem for future me. In the afternoon, I have that video call with our biggest client and show them how the new import feature works. They didn’t see the big button that is clearly labeled “Import” in the navigation bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After my call, I have a quick break for coffee, and then a customer success team meeting with the VP of Sales to discuss upselling some of our smaller clients to higher tiers and promoting some of the 3rd party integrations (which also cost more and bring in about 50% of Geyser’s revenue). We make a list of the clients that will most likely need upselling, and each of us on the CS team takes 1 or 2 to call and discuss. We also talk about sales strategy and what to say on the call to get the client interested in the add-on functionality. By this time, it’s already 4PM, and I spend my last hour at work answering emails and making sure I’ve closed out all the tickets from the day in our ticketing system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-your-favorite-part-of-being-in-customer-success&quot;&gt;What’s your favorite part of being in Customer Success?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the teamwork and camaraderie of it. My best friend from high school is also a CSM here, and we spend a lot of time together. We also go out to happy hour each week, and we learn a lot from each other. For example, my manager has taught me around 40 different ways to say “no” politely. It’s super useful outside of work, like in dating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-your-least-favorite-part-of-your-job&quot;&gt;What’s your least favorite part of your job?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can’t complain too much, but I would say the unpredictability. When our clients in Europe get mad, we’re supposed to respond ASAP. We take turns being “on call,” but it means answering random texts and emails at 3AM one or two nights a week. It also can be unpleasant sometimes to deal with unhappy customers. We’re used to it, and we laugh about it afterwards, but fielding those calls can be extra draining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-to-do-next&quot;&gt;What do you want to do next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to move into a more technical role. I’ve never thought of myself as a software person, but this job showed me that I really like the details and understanding how Geyser’s complicated software works under the hood. I actually wrote most of our knowledge base from scratch. I’ve also been learning SQL and data analytics, so I think I’d like to try a software or data bootcamp, or maybe a role in technical support or software quality assurance (QA) to actually find bugs and fix them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-wants-to-do-customer-success&quot;&gt;What advice would you give to someone who wants to do Customer Success?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a great entry level position because you can learn everything on the job. My advice would be to talk to other people who do CS and try to meet their teams. It’s really about finding a team where you fit in and feel comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entry-level Customer Success Associates often go on to become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer Success Manager&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Analyst / Business Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product Manager&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales / Account Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some additional training, they go on to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
