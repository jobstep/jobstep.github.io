JobStep was founded by Eleanor Meegoda and Nikhil Deshmukh to help workers take advantage of growing career pathways.

## What is this website about?

This website offers a new way to think about finding jobs based on the skills you already have instead of job title, location, or salary.

## Why do job boards suck so much?

Job boards are paid for by employers based on the number of clicks that each job post gets. This is a problem because:
1.  Recruiters and hiring managers are overwhelmed by a large number of irrelevant applications, making it hard for you to be seen.
2.  It's too expensive for small businesses, so you miss out on those opportunities.
3.  Job descriptions become more like advertisements and don't actually tell you about the work itself.
